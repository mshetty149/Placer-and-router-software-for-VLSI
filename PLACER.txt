Placer uses quadratic wirelength model to minimize the total wirelength of placing gates in the grid.

Placer uses recursive partitioning to separate gates into separate regions where 8x8 produces 64 regions.

Placer consists of 3 steps quadratic placement, assignment and containment.

1. Quadratic Placement gives the positions as output.
2. Assignment distributes the gates into left right or up down  for partitioning 
3. Containment creates virtual pads to contain the gates with the region during quadratic placement.

The placer program (placer.cpp) takes the number of gates,number of nets, number of pads and their positions are given as input and assumes the size of grid (100,100).
