Router works using Maze Routing Algorithm which uses min heap with cost as key for expansion fron source till target.

The router is capable of routing 2 point nets over 2 layers with a given bend and via penalty with non uniform cost on each grid to avoid congestion

Input needs .grid and .nl netlist file where grid gives the config info about penalty and grid size and netlist contains the number of nets and source, target pairs for each netid. 

The router.cpp gives the routed path as OUTPUT File for each net in the for
/// 1        -> NET NUMBER 1
/// 1 4 8    -> SOURCE
/// 1 4 7
//  1 4 6    -> TARGET
// 0         -> END
